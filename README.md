# scripts

mission: make life in the terminal easier


all suggestions welcome

focus points:
  - ease of navigation
  - associative memory of script offshoots*

* script offshoot: e.g: nmap-fast-scan. in all likelihood a terminal command will be used in a certain way by a certain user
each time they used it based on their own preferences and usage of scripts. I personally use ls as ls and ls -la almost exclusively.
hence it makes sense that la has an alias shortcut in the ubuntu .bashrc to enable such frequent usage. the purpose of these script
offshoots is to provide a similar utility
